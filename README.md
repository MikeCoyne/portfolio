This is the professional portfolio for Michael Coyne. It contains sections related to general background, work examples, and contact information. 
Images borrowed from the www include: "Feelings wheel", sunglasses image from a google search, and a random cell phone image. 

It includes a navigation bar near the top of the page, which links to 1)about me section; 2) work link, which have placeholder links for now; and
3) a few contact links. 

There is a "back to the top" link towards the bottom of the page, followed by the final link, an image of me in a bunny suit. It links
 to a website called Bandcamp.com, where my album is posted online.
